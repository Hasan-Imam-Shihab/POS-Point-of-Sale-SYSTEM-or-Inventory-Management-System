Project Purpose:
This project is designed to give the sellers and consumers a hassle free automated  billing system which allows processing and recording of every transaction between the organisation or shop and consumers or suppliers  where the owner can keep track of every purchase and sale transaction of the organisation or shop.

Project Goals and Objectives:
To allow admin and operators to enter into the system by login with specific username and password.
To allow the admin to create accounts for operators whenever needed.
To provide the admin and operators with an efficient product management system where admin or operator can insert new products, edit existing products and purchase listed products.
To provide the functionality to admin and operators to sell existing products and generate bill receipt if the available quantity of a product is sufficient to sell.
To allow only the admin to see all the purchase and sell transaction reports for a required time period.
To allow only the admin to change his/her password. 

Project Description:
In this project I have designed a POS system. A POS system is simply known as the POINT OF Sale system. As there must be a huge amount of product items in a shop therefore, it is too difficult to keep track and manage every product.  But with  this POS  system a user can easily manage products and sell products and can keep records of activity of the system. In this system there are two types of user, one is admin and another one is operator. Only admin have the permission to create new accounts for operators. Operators can only access the product management and sell functionality where admin have the permission to all the functionality of the system. The sell function allows the admin and operator to add multiple products to cart and generate bills  after completing the process. The managed product functionality allows admin and operators to add new products to the list, update the existing products and purchase the products in the list for sale. The generated report functionality will provide the sale and purchase report only to admin for the required time period. Therefore we can say that with this system a user will be able to manage his/her shop's sales, purchases and products and can keep track of everything.  

Scope:
This project can be used in every grocery shop, clothing shop, super shop and with some small modification this project can be used in small industries or organisations where purchase and sales are the main focus.
